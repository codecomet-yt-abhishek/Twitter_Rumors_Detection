This project involves an end-to-end automated data pipeline that migrates data from AWS S3 to Azure Cloud using Azure Data Factory (ADF) 
with SSIS Integration Runtime (IR). The migrated data is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2), 
where it undergoes advanced processing and analysis.


Key Components & Technologies Used:
-------------------------------------
Data Migration: ADF SSIS IR facilitates seamless data transfer from AWS S3 to Azure.

Data Storage: Data is stored in ADLS Gen2, ensuring scalability and security.

Big Data Processing: Applied PySpark in Databricks to analyze Twitter data for rumor detection.

Performance Optimization: Implemented optimization techniques such as partitioning, caching, and query tuning for efficient data processing.

Data Warehouse & Analytics: The final processed data is loaded into Azure Synapse Analytics.

Automation & Scalability: The pipeline is fully automated, ensuring real-time data processing and analysis with minimal manual intervention.



Business Impact & Insights:
-----------------------------
Scalable Data Pipeline: Efficiently handles large-scale Twitter data.

AI-Driven Insights: Enhances rumor detection accuracy using machine learning and PySpark.

Optimized Query Performance: Reduces latency in data processing and analytics.

Cloud-Native Architecture: Uses serverless and cloud-native technologies for cost-effectiveness.


Outcome:
--------
This project successfully automates the migration, processing, and analysis of social media data, delivering real-time insights 
and supporting decision-making in rumor detection and trend analysis.
